* name field is not limited with regexp ( it used to be limited with ^([-a-z0-9._/])+$ )
* added bareNumber attribute to number and integer field types - a boolean field with a default of `true`. If `true` the physical contents of this field must follow the formatting constraints already set out. If `false` the contents of this field may contain leading and/or trailing non-numeric characters (which implementors MUST therefore strip). The purpose of `bareNumber` is to allow publishers to publish numeric data that contains trailing characters such as percentages e.g. `95%` or leading characters such as currencies e.g. `â‚¬95` or `EUR 95`. Note that it is entirely up to implementors what, if anything, they do with stripped text.
* removed currency attribute from number field types
